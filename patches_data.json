Additionally, after dealing damage 3 times with Basic Attacks or skills, Benedetta' Sword Intent gauge falls slightly short of being full, affecting the controls of her Swordout Slash combos. Therefore, we've increased the amout of Sword Intent gained from dealing damage. It now only takes 3 hits from Basic Attacks or skills to fully charge her Sword Intent.
