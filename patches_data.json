Meanwhile, Skill 1 has been redesigned to grant a shield and speed boost, reducing her dependence on bushes.\n\nWe've also optimized the control experience of Basic Attacks after Skill 2, improving passive stacking efficiency and combo smoothness.\n\nTo balance this, we've reduced how much the Passive Wilderness Mark reduces Physical & Magic Defense."
