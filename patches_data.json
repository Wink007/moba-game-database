        "designers_note": "In high-tier Ranked games and professional matches, Junglers have the biggest impact on early-to-mid game tempo, while Exp Lane heroes rarely have standout performances. Sometimes, Exp Lane heroes even have to purchase defensive equipment to take on the role of damage soaking and give up their resources to other teammates.<br/><br/>We aim to give Exp Lane fighters more opportunities to dominate in the mid game, while slightly reducing Junglers' early-game tempo and balancing creep-clearing speeds among different Jungler heroes to prevent excessive disparities.<br/><br/>Additionally, we find that the Healing Reduction effect from equipment is currently too strong, creating a big difference in how well healing-dependent heroes perform, based heavily on whether enemies purchase equipment with this effect. Therefore, we are reducing the Healing Reduction effect, while also adjusting heroes, equipment, and skills with overly high healing to maintain balance.<br/><br/>Finally, we've enhanced the Resilience attribute to reduce the duration of Airborne control effects. However, we've also decreased the Resilience provided by certain equipment. Due to Airborne now being affected by the new Resilience effect, we will make adjustments to heroes whose combo relies on Airborne to minimize the impact, while providing other compensatory buffs to heroes whose core feature is Airborne but doesn't affect their combo.<br/><br/>Good luck ranking up in the new season!",

If it hits an enemy, she automatically casts the next [Phoenix Wave], up to 3 times. Zetian can cast other skills during this process. The third [Phoenix Wave] hits a larger area and pulls targets in the skill's direction for a short distance.<br/><br/><strong>[Skill 2 - Phoenix Descent]</strong><br/>Zetian summons a [Phoenix Spirit] at the target location, dealing Magic Damage and applying a brief slow effect to enemies in the area. The [Phoenix Spirit] hovers at the location for 3s, dealing sustained Magic Damage to enemies in a range and reducing enemies' Magic Defense. While the [Phoenix Spirit] is active, Zetian can use this skill again to command the [Phoenix Spirit] to charge toward a designated location, dealing Magic Damage and applying a brief slow effect upon arrival.<br/><br/><strong>[Ultimate - Fury of the Phoenix]</strong><br/>Zetian grants all allied heroes a Movement Speed increase that gradually decays over 3 sec, while unleashing divine retribution upon all enemy heroes, dealing Magic Damage and stunning them on hit.<br/>During this time, Zetian gains vision of all enemy heroes. She can cast other skills while channeling this ability."

During this time, heroes gain a Passive to detect nearby concealed enemy heroes. However, Stone Roamers will no longer spawn.<br/>4- EXP Scavenger Crab Changes: Gains Damage Reduction when HP falls below 50%. The killer gains additional benefits: increased Max HP and a Shield when at low HP.<br/>5- Gold Scavenger Crab Changes: Gains Extra Damage, Attack Speed, and Movement Speed Bonus when HP falls below 50%. The killer gains additional benefits: Adaptive Attack, Attack Speed, and the ability to deal Extra Damage and slow enemy heroes when attacking them.<br/>6- New Lord Special Mechanics- Roaring Strike: If the Lord hasn't engaged in combat for a while after spawning, it will enter a charging state. After charging for 10 sec, the Lord will move to the other river area. The Lord's charging can be interrupted by damage, but once it enters the movement state, it becomes invincible and cannot be interrupted."
