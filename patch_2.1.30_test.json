      "summary": "Hilda's late-game minion clearing efficiency and durability are low, and she relies on Bushes to trigger her passive effect, leaving her with average performance in the Exp Lane. So this time we redesigned Hilda's passive skill, changing the enhanced Basic Attack originally obtained from Skill 1 to entering a Bush, improving her Exp Lane presence and minion clearing efficiency. Meanwhile, Skill 1 has been redesigned to grant a shield and speed boost, reducing her dependence on bushes. We've also optimized the control experience of Basic Attacks after Skill 2, improving passive stacking efficiency and combo smoothness. To balance this, we've reduced how much the Passive Wilderness Mark reduces Physical & Magic Defense.",

Therefore, we've shortened the detection time for entering the Swordout state when holding the Basic Attack button, allowing Benedetta to enter the state more quickly and improving control fluidity and responsiveness. Additionally, after dealing damage 3 times with Basic Attacks or skills, Benedetta' Sword Intent gauge falls slightly short of being full, affecting the controls of her Swordout Slash combos. Therefore, we've increased the amout of Sword Intent gained from dealing damage. It now only takes 3 hits from Basic Attacks or skills to fully charge her Sword Intent. We've also fixed an issue where Benedetta would continue charging Swordout Slash after being interrupted by control effects, which could cause her to cast her it unintentionally once the control effect ended.",
